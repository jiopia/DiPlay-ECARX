/**
 * Publishes CarPlay's now-playing state to an ECARX (亿咖通) instrument cluster — the media half of
 * the cluster work whose navigation half is [EcarxHudBridge].
 *
 * **Why the cluster had nothing to show.** Two independent reasons, and this class only fixes the
 * second one:
 *  * The card the cluster *did* show while CarPlay played was the head unit's own Bluetooth music
 *    source reading AVRCP metadata off the iPhone — not anything DiPlay sent. Turning the head
 *    unit's Bluetooth adapter off (the `yield_adapter` switch, used to stop that same source from
 *    pausing CarPlay audio) takes that card with it.
 *  * `EcarxDimApi.mediaInteraction` — the only way into the DIM media channel — had **no caller at
 *    all** since the day it was written. This class is that caller.
 *
 * The call sequence is the shipped ECARX projection tool's, recovered from its bytecode:
 * `updateCurrentSourceType(6)` once per session, then `updatePlaybackInfo` plus `updatePlaylist`,
 * and `updateCurrentProgress` separately. `IMediaInteraction` declares no callback registration, so this is a one-way feed —
 * steering-wheel keys still reach CarPlay through Android's media session (`CarPlayMediaKeys`).
 *
 * What is recovered, what is ours, and what is deliberately missing:
 *  * **Recovered.** The four method names and their descriptors, `sourceType = 6`,
 *    `getPlaybackStatus()` ∈ {1, 2} (`MediaHandler.formatPlaybackStatus` maps 1 to `"play"`, 2 to
 *    `"pause"` and returns `null` for anything else), both payload interfaces, and the topics the
 *    cluster service republishes them on (`ihu/info/media/playback/status`, `.../progress`,
 *    `.../sources`).
 *  * **Ours.** The toolkit pins `getPlaybackStatus()` at `1` and never reports a pause. We send 2
 *    when the iPhone is paused: the cluster already understands it, so there is no reason to lie.
 *  * **Missing on purpose.** Artwork. The cluster service turns the payload's `Uri` into base64 TGA
 *    through `com.nostra13.universalimageloader`, which fetches `http`/`file`/`content` and nothing
 *    else; a track that exists only inside CarPlay's stream has no such URL. See
 *    [EcarxDimApi.PlaybackInfo].
 *
 * Off by default ([EcarxOutputSettings.mediaEnabled]) until the car confirms the cluster took it.
 * Independent of the navigation switch: this is a separate DIM channel with its own handle, its own
 * worker and its own failure, so a head unit whose guidance path never comes up can still show a
 * media card and the other way round.
