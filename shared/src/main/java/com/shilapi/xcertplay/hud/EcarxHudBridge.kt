/**
 * Publishes CarPlay guidance to an ECARX (亿咖通) instrument cluster through the XUI DIM API.
 *
 * The call sequence is the one the shipped ECARX projection tool uses, recovered from its
 * bytecode (a Runnable the tool posts every 1000 ms):
 * ```
 * navi.updateNavigationInfo(info); navi.updateTurnByTurnArrow(v++);
 * ```
 * so the field order and the 1 s cadence here are not invented.
 *
 * What is proven vs. what needs calibration on the car:
 *  * **Proven.** `updateNavigationInfo` with the 15-getter `INavigationInfo` payload; the getter
 *    set is exhaustive (the tool's implementation class implements exactly these); `updateDistanceToDestination`,
 *    `updateDistanceToNextGuidancePoint`, `updateETA`, `updateNextGuidancePointName`,
 *    `updateLaneInfo`, `notifyTurnByTurnStarted/Stopped` take the arguments used below.
 *  * **Proven — and the arrow is drawn, not coded.** The head unit's own navigation app
 *    (`ecarx.naviservice`, the shipped 导航) renders the manoeuvre into SVG markup in
 *    `ecarx/naviservice/widget/f.smali` and pushes it through `updateTurnByTurnArrow(String)`
 *    (`ecarx/naviservice/a/g.smali`, log tag `NaviDashboardManager`); it never calls the `(Bitmap)`
 *    overload, and it skips the `int` overload entirely when the code is `<= 0`. So the SVG
 *    overload is the primary path here ([turnArrowSvg]); a locally drawn bitmap is the fallback for
 *    a head unit that lacks it, and the recovered code table ([EcarxArrowCode]) the last resort.
 *  * **Needs calibration.** `getDrivingDirection()` is a bare `int` whose scale was never
 *    recovered, so it carries [DRIVING_DIRECTION_UNKNOWN] instead of Apple's flag dressed up as
 *    data. The arrow is still gated behind [EcarxOutputSettings.turnArrowExperimental] until the
 *    car confirms what the cluster actually draws.
 *
 * Every ECARX call is reflection-only (see [EcarxDimApi]): a direct reference would turn a
 * missing system class into a `NoClassDefFoundError` on every non-ECARX head unit.

     *    `naviAppOff` within 3 ms. Those two events are the **reply**, not the input — which is why

     * platform's page and follows with its own window on the same display (fix36, see
     * [clusterPresentationRequested]), which is the handover the driver used to see as a flash.
     *
     * It does **not** report whether the cluster changed, because nothing can: the platform call is
     * `void`, unchecked, and returns the same thing whether or not the cluster is even powered.
     * [EcarxResult.ok] here means "the watch owns delivery now"; the switch reports a failure only
