/**
 * The ECARX instrument-cluster output: three switches, each one a picture the driver can see.
 *
 * Kept in its own preferences file so the ECARX switches never alias another head unit's switches
 * by accident, and so a build that ships the same code on a different head unit has an inert,
 * empty store.
 *
 * **Six switches were removed from this store** (fix33). Every one of them was a question the car
 * had already answered, and leaving them on the settings page meant the driver had to get six
 * answers right before the cluster showed anything — six chances to get it wrong where one would do:
 *
 * | removed | why it is not a question any more |
 * |---|---|
 * | 投屏包名 (`setPresentationToDimSwitch` 的两个字符串) | the platform discards the first three arguments; `""` is what the stock apps send, and the only value measured working on this head unit |
 * | 箭头实验开关 | the ids are settled (`EcarxArrowCode` + the on-car 101–143 sweep), it is not an experiment |
 * | 导航投影轴 (`carPlayNavigation`) | the projection MQTT claim is what turns the cluster's navigation page into a rectangle of mirrored CarPlay — never wanted |
 * | 媒体投影轴 (`carPlayMedia`) | without it the media card reads `无媒体` whatever is pushed; there is no picture in which it should be off |
 * | 导航进行中事件 (`ongoingNavi`) | it raises the floating distance/turn card inside the projection and DiPlay cannot close it again (its `idle` is ignored by this firmware) |
 * | 集群导航模式 (`setNaviMode`) | `ecarx.dimprotocol.DIMProtocolManager` is absent from this system image, so the switch could only ever fail |
